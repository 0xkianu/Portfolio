Over 97% of websites use it, and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.  JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is essential for web applications. It is used to add dynamic and interactive elements to web pages, such as menus, forms, animations, and games. It is also used to create web servers and mobile apps.',

Because React is only concerned with the user interface and rendering components to the DOM, React applications often rely on libraries for routing and other client-side functionality.  A key advantage of React is that it only rerenders those parts of the page that have changed, avoiding unnecessary rerendering of unchanged DOM elements.',
